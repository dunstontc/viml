v:beval_col	The number of the column, over which the mouse pointer is.
		This is the byte index in the |v:beval_lnum| line.
		Only valid while evaluating the 'balloonexpr' option.


v:beval_bufnr	The number of the buffer, over which the mouse pointer is. Only
		valid while evaluating the 'balloonexpr' option.


v:beval_lnum	The number of the line, over which the mouse pointer is. Only
		valid while evaluating the 'balloonexpr' option.


v:beval_text	The text under or after the mouse pointer.  Usually a word as
		it is useful for debugging a C program.  'iskeyword' applies,
		but a dot and "->" before the position is included.  When on a
		']' the text before it is used, including the matching '[' and
		word before it.  When on a Visual area within one line the
		highlighted text is used.
		Only valid while evaluating the 'balloonexpr' option.


v:beval_winnr	The number of the window, over which the mouse pointer is. Only
		valid while evaluating the 'balloonexpr' option.  The first
		window has number zero (unlike most other places where a
		window gets a number).


v:char		Argument for evaluating 'formatexpr' and used for the typed
		character when using <expr> in an abbreviation |:map-<expr>|.


v:charconvert_from
		The name of the character encoding of a file to be converted.
		Only valid while evaluating the 'charconvert' option.


v:charconvert_to
		The name of the character encoding of a file after conversion.
		Only valid while evaluating the 'charconvert' option.


v:cmdarg	This variable is used for two purposes:
		1. The extra arguments given to a file read/write command.
		   Currently these are "++enc=" and "++ff=".  This variable is
		   set before an autocommand event for a file read/write
		   command is triggered.  There is a leading space to make it
		   possible to append this variable directly after the
		   read/write command.	Note: The "+cmd" argument isn't
		   included here, because it will be executed anyway.
		2. When printing a PostScript file with ":hardcopy" this is
		   the argument for the ":hardcopy" command.  This can be used
		   in 'printexpr'.


v:cmdbang	Set like v:cmdarg for a file read/write command.  When a "!"
		was used the value is 1, otherwise it is 0.  Note that this
		can only be used in autocommands.  For user commands |<bang>|
		can be used.


v:count		The count given for the last Normal mode command.  Can be used
		to get the count before a mapping.  Read-only.	Example:
	:map _x :<C-U>echo "the count is " . v:count<CR>
 		Note: The <C-U> is required to remove the line range that you
		get when typing ':' after a count.
		When there are two counts, as in "3d2w", they are multiplied,
		just like what happens in the command, "d6w" for the example.
		Also used for evaluating the 'formatexpr' option.
		"count" also works, for backwards compatibility.


v:count1	Just like "v:count", but defaults to one when no count is
		used.


v:ctype		The current locale setting for characters of the runtime
		environment.  This allows Vim scripts to be aware of the
		current locale encoding.  Technical: it's the value of
		LC_CTYPE.  When not using a locale the value is "C".
		This variable can not be set directly, use the |:language|
		command.
		See |multi-lang|.


v:dying		Normally zero.	When a deadly signal is caught it's set to
		one.  When multiple signals are caught the number increases.
		Can be used in an autocommand to check if Vim didn't
		terminate normally. {only works on Unix}
		Example:
	:au VimLeave * if v:dying | echo "\nAAAAaaaarrrggghhhh!!!\n" | endif
 		Note: if another deadly signal is caught when v:dying is one,
		VimLeave autocommands will not be executed.


v:errmsg	Last given error message.  It's allowed to set this variable.
		Example:
	:let v:errmsg = ""
	:silent! next
	:if v:errmsg != ""
	:  ... handle error
 		"errmsg" also works, for backwards compatibility.


v:exception	The value of the exception most recently caught and not
		finished.  See also |v:throwpoint| and |throw-variables|.
		Example:
	:try
	:  throw "oops"
	:catch /.*/
	:  echo "caught" v:exception
	:endtry
 		Output: "caught oops".


v:fcs_reason	The reason why the |FileChangedShell| event was triggered.
		Can be used in an autocommand to decide what to do and/or what
		to set v:fcs_choice to.  Possible values:
			deleted		file no longer exists
			conflict	file contents, mode or timestamp was
					changed and buffer is modified
			changed		file contents has changed
			mode		mode of file changed
			time		only file timestamp changed


v:fcs_choice	What should happen after a |FileChangedShell| event was
		triggered.  Can be used in an autocommand to tell Vim what to
		do with the affected buffer:
			reload		Reload the buffer (does not work if
					the file was deleted).
			ask		Ask the user what to do, as if there
					was no autocommand.  Except that when
					only the timestamp changed nothing
					will happen.
			<empty>		Nothing, the autocommand should do
					everything that needs to be done.
		The default is empty.  If another (invalid) value is used then
		Vim behaves like it is empty, there is no warning message.


v:fname_in	The name of the input file.  Valid while evaluating:
			option		used for
			'charconvert'	file to be converted
			'diffexpr'	original file
			'patchexpr'	original file
			'printexpr'	file to be printed
		And set to the swap file name for |SwapExists|.


v:fname_out	The name of the output file.  Only valid while
		evaluating:
			option		used for
			'charconvert'	resulting converted file (*)
			'diffexpr'	output of diff
			'patchexpr'	resulting patched file
		(*) When doing conversion for a write command (e.g., ":w
		file") it will be equal to v:fname_in.	When doing conversion
		for a read command (e.g., ":e file") it will be a temporary
		file and different from v:fname_in.


v:fname_new	The name of the new version of the file.  Only valid while
		evaluating 'diffexpr'.


v:fname_diff	The name of the diff (patch) file.  Only valid while
		evaluating 'patchexpr'.


v:folddashes	Used for 'foldtext': dashes representing foldlevel of a closed
		fold.
		Read-only in the |sandbox|. |fold-foldtext|


v:foldlevel	Used for 'foldtext': foldlevel of closed fold.
		Read-only in the |sandbox|. |fold-foldtext|


v:foldend	Used for 'foldtext': last line of closed fold.
		Read-only in the |sandbox|. |fold-foldtext|


v:foldstart	Used for 'foldtext': first line of closed fold.
		Read-only in the |sandbox|. |fold-foldtext|


v:insertmode	Used for the |InsertEnter| and |InsertChange| autocommand
		events.  Values:
			i	Insert mode
			r	Replace mode
			v	Virtual Replace mode


v:key		Key of the current item of a |Dictionary|.  Only valid while
		evaluating the expression used with |map()| and |filter()|.
		Read-only.


v:lang		The current locale setting for messages of the runtime
		environment.  This allows Vim scripts to be aware of the
		current language.  Technical: it's the value of LC_MESSAGES.
		The value is system dependent.
		This variable can not be set directly, use the |:language|
		command.
		It can be different from |v:ctype| when messages are desired
		in a different language than what is used for character
		encoding.  See |multi-lang|.


v:lc_time	The current locale setting for time messages of the runtime
		environment.  This allows Vim scripts to be aware of the
		current language.  Technical: it's the value of LC_TIME.
		This variable can not be set directly, use the |:language|
		command.  See |multi-lang|.


v:lnum		Line number for the 'foldexpr' |fold-expr|, 'formatexpr' and
		'indentexpr' expressions, tab page number for 'guitablabel'
		and 'guitabtooltip'.  Only valid while one of these
		expressions is being evaluated.  Read-only when in the
		|sandbox|.


v:mouse_win	Window number for a mouse click obtained with |getchar()|.
		First window has number 1, like with |winnr()|.  The value is
		zero when there was no mouse button click.


v:mouse_lnum	Line number for a mouse click obtained with |getchar()|.
		This is the text line number, not the screen line number.  The
		value is zero when there was no mouse button click.


v:mouse_col	Column number for a mouse click obtained with |getchar()|.
		This is the screen column number, like with |virtcol()|.  The
		value is zero when there was no mouse button click.


v:oldfiles	List of file names that is loaded from the |viminfo| file on
		startup.  These are the files that Vim remembers marks for.
		The length of the List is limited by the '' argument of the
		'viminfo' option (default is 100).
		Also see |:oldfiles| and |c_#<|.
		The List can be modified, but this has no effect on what is
		stored in the |viminfo| file later.  If you use values other
		than String this will cause trouble.
		{only when compiled with the |+viminfo| feature}


v:operator	The last operator given in Normal mode.  This is a single
		character except for commands starting with <g> or <z>,
		in which case it is two characters.  Best used alongside
		|v:prevcount| and |v:register|.  Useful if you want to cancel
		Operator-pending mode and then use the operator, e.g.:
			:omap O <Esc>:call MyMotion(v:operator)<CR>
 		The value remains set until another operator is entered, thus
		don't expect it to be empty.
		v:operator is not set for |:delete|, |:yank| or other Ex
		commands.
		Read-only.


v:prevcount	The count given for the last but one Normal mode command.
		This is the v:count value of the previous command.  Useful if
		you want to cancel Visual or Operator-pending mode and then
		use the count, e.g.:
			:vmap % <Esc>:call MyFilter(v:prevcount)<CR>
 		Read-only.


v:profiling	Normally zero.	Set to one after using ":profile start".
		See |profiling|.


v:progname	Contains the name (with path removed) with which Vim was
		invoked.  Allows you to do special initialisations for "view",
		"evim" etc., or any other name you might symlink to Vim.
		Read-only.


v:register	The name of the register in effect for the current normal mode
		command.  If none is supplied it is the default register.
		Also see |getreg()| and |setreg()|


v:scrollstart	String describing the script or function that caused the
		screen to scroll up.  It's only set when it is empty, thus the
		first reason is remembered.  It is set to "Unknown" for a
		typed command.
		This can be used to find out why your script causes the
		hit-enter prompt.


v:servername	The resulting registered |x11-clientserver| name if any.
		Read-only.



v:searchforward
		Search direction:  1 after a forward search, 0 after a
		backward search.  It is reset to forward when directly setting
		the last search pattern, see |quote/|.
		Note that the value is restored when returning from a
		function. |function-search-undo|.
		Read-write.


v:shell_error	Result of the last shell command.  When non-zero, the last
		shell command had an error.  When zero, there was no problem.
		This only works when the shell returns the error code to Vim.
		The value -1 is often used when the command could not be
		executed.  Read-only.
		Example:
	:!mv foo bar
	:if v:shell_error
	:  echo 'could not rename "foo" to "bar"!'
	:endif
 		"shell_error" also works, for backwards compatibility.


v:statusmsg	Last given status message.  It's allowed to set this variable.


v:swapname	Only valid when executing |SwapExists| autocommands: Name of the swap file found.  Read-only.


v:swapchoice	|SwapExists| autocommands can set this to the selected choice
		for handling an existing swap file:
			'o'	Open read-only
			'e'	Edit anyway
			'r'	Recover
			'd'	Delete swapfile
			'q'	Quit
			'a'	Abort
		The value should be a single-character string.	An empty value
		results in the user being asked, as would happen when there is
		no SwapExists autocommand.  The default is empty.


v:swapcommand	Normal mode command to be executed after a file has been
		opened.  Can be used for a |SwapExists| autocommand to have
		another Vim open the file and jump to the right place.	For
		example, when jumping to a tag the value is ":tag tagname\r".
		For ":edit +cmd file" the value is ":cmd\r".


v:termresponse	The escape sequence returned by the terminal for the |t_RV|
		termcap entry.	It is set when Vim receives an escape sequence
		that starts with ESC [ or CSI and ends in a 'c', with only
		digits, ';' and '.' in between.
		When this option is set, the TermResponse autocommand event is
		fired, so that you can react to the response from the
		terminal.
		The response from a new xterm is: "<Esc>[ Pp ; Pv ; Pc c".  Pp
		is the terminal type: 0 for vt100 and 1 for vt220.  Pv is the
		patch level (since this was introduced in patch 95, it's
		always 95 or bigger).  Pc is always zero.
		{only when compiled with |+termresponse| feature}


v:this_session	Full filename of the last loaded or saved session file.  See
		|:mksession|.  It is allowed to set this variable.  When no
		session file has been saved, this variable is empty.
		"this_session" also works, for backwards compatibility.


v:throwpoint	The point where the exception most recently caught and not
		finished was thrown.  Not set when commands are typed.	See
		also |v:exception| and |throw-variables|.


v:val		Value of the current item of a |List| or |Dictionary|.	Only
		valid while evaluating the expression used with |map()| and
		|filter()|.  Read-only.


v:version	Version number of Vim: Major version number times 100 plus
		minor version number.  Version 5.0 is 500.  Version 5.1 (5.01)
		is 501.  Read-only.  "version" also works, for backwards
		compatibility.
		Use |has()| to check if a certain patch was included, e.g.:
			if has("patch123")
 		Note that patch numbers are specific to the version, thus both
		version 5.0 and 5.1 may have a patch 123, but these are
		completely different.


v:warningmsg	Last given warning message.  It's allowed to set this variable.


v:windowid	When any X11 based GUI is running or when running in a
		terminal and Vim connects to the X server (|-X|) this will be
		set to the window ID.
		When an MS-Windows GUI is running this will be set to the
		window handle.
		Otherwise the value is zero.
		Note: for windows inside Vim use |winnr()|.
